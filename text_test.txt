Deodorant is used to help reduce body odor, which is the smell that can come from sweating. When we sweat, bacteria on our skin can break down the sweat and produce a smell. Deodorant contains antimicrobial agents that can kill the bacteria and help reduce body odor. It also often contains fragrances that can help cover up any remaining smell.\n\nWhile it is true that some animals use their natural smells to attract a mate, humans do not typically rely on body odor as a way of attracting a partner. In fact, body odor can be considered unpleasant by some people. Using deodorant can help us feel more clean and fresh, and can help us feel more confident in social situations.
A surname is a family name passed down from one generation to another, while a given name is a personal name given to an individual at birth or at a young age. The given name is also sometimes referred to as a first name or a forename.\n\nIn many cultures, the surname is the last name and is used to identify a person within a family or a larger social group. The given name, on the other hand, is the first name and is usually used to address or refer to a person.\n\nFor example, if a person's full name is "John Smith," "John" is the given name and "Smith" is the surname. In some cultures, the given name is followed by the surname, while in others, the surname comes before the given name.
