Existing approaches for query graph generation ignore the semantic structure of a question, resulting in a large number of noisy query graph candidates that undermine prediction accuracies. In this paper, we define six semantic structures from common questions in KGQA and develop a novel Structure-BERT to predict the semantic structure of a question. By doing so, we can first filter out noisy candidate query graphs by the predicted semantic structures, and then rank the remaining candidates with a BERT-based ranking model.

To achieve this, lexical resources such as WordNet have been found to be useful in knowledge-based methods. However, previous neural network-based WSD methods have only relied on large amounts of labeled data, ignoring lexical resources such as glosses (sense definitions). In this study, we present GAS, a gloss-augmented WSD neural network that combines the context and glosses of the target word to take full advantage of both labeled data and lexical knowledge. Our model uses an improved memory network framework to encode the semantic relationship between the context and gloss, breaking down the limitations of previous supervised and knowledge-based methods. Additionally, we have enhanced the original gloss of the word sense by incorporating semantic relations found in WordNet. Our experiments demonstrate that GAS outperforms state-of-the-art systems on several English all-words WSD datasets.",

To encourage the auxiliary source-pivot and pivot-target translation models to work in the same pivot language space, we initialize some parameters of the pivot side with a pre-trained language model and freeze them.

However, current retrieval methods are either heuristic or intertwined with the reasoning process, leading to partial subgraph reasoning and increasing the bias when intermediate supervision is lacking. To address these issues, this paper presents a trainable subgraph retriever (SR) that is decoupled from the subsequent reasoning process. This allows for a plug-and-play framework that can enhance any subgraph-oriented KBQA model. Our experiments demonstrate that SR outperforms existing retrieval methods and achieves new state-of-the-art performance when combined with NSM (He et al., 2021), a subgraph-oriented reasoner, for embedding-based KBQA methods. The codes and datasets used in this research are available online (https://github.com/RUCKBReasoning/SubgraphRetrievalKBQA) for reproducibility and further study.",

In this work, we investigate Chinese OEI with extremely-noisy crowdsourcing annotations, constructing a dataset at a very low cost. Following Zhang el al.

Firstly, we discover that the success of magnitude pruning can be attributed to the preserved pre-training performance, which correlates with the downstream transferability. Inspired by this, we propose to directly optimize the subnetwork structure towards the pre-training objectives, which can better preserve the pre-training performance. Specifically, we train binary masks over model weights on the pre-training tasks, with the aim of preserving the universal transferability of the subnetwork, which is agnostic to any specific downstream tasks. We then fine-tune the subnetworks on the GLUE benchmark and the SQuAD dataset. The results show that, compared with magnitude pruning, mask training can effectively find BERT subnetworks with improved overall performance on downstream tasks.

These multimedia elements often make rumors appear more credible, making it a pressing need to find an automatic way to verify these rumors. Previous research on rumor verification only considered multimedia content as input features. Our approach is different, as we do not use the multimedia content itself, but instead find external information on other news platforms that can be used to verify the rumors. We introduce a new set of features, cross-lingual cross-platform features, which leverage the semantic similarity between the rumors and external information. When implemented, machine learning methods utilizing these features have achieved state-of-the-art results in rumor verification.",

To address this issue, we introduce CSL, a large-scale Chinese Scientific Literature dataset containing 396k papers with titles, abstracts, keywords, and academic fields. To the best of our knowledge, CSL is the first scientific document dataset in Chinese and can serve as a valuable corpus for NLP research. This semi-structured data also provides a natural annotation for various supervised NLP tasks. Based on CSL, we present a benchmark to evaluate the performance of models across scientific domain tasks such as summarization, keyword generation, and text classification. Our analysis of existing text-to-text models on these evaluation tasks highlights the challenges of Chinese scientific NLP and provides a valuable reference for future research.

It reformulates the XNLI problem to a masked language modeling problem by constructing cloze-style questions through cross-lingual templates. To enforce correspondence between different languages, the framework augments a new question for every question using a sampled template in another language and then introduces a consistency loss to make the answer probability distribution obtained from the new question as similar as possible with the corresponding distribution obtained from the original question. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that XNLI models enhanced by our proposed framework significantly outperform original ones under both the full-shot and few-shot cross-lingual transfer settings.",

Unfortunately, this definition of probing has been subject to extensive criticism in the literature, and has been observed to lead to paradoxical and counter-intuitive results. In the theoretical portion of this paper, we take the position that the goal of probing ought to be measuring the amount of inductive bias that the representations encode on a specific task. We further describe a Bayesian framework that operationalizes this goal and allows us to quantify the representations' inductive bias. In the empirical portion of the paper, we apply our framework to a variety of NLP tasks. Our results suggest that our proposed framework alleviates many previous problems found in probing.

Given reviews from different domains, some existing methods for word embeddings exploit sentiment information, but they cannot produce domain-sensitive embeddings. On the other hand, some other existing methods can generate domain-sensitive word embeddings, but they cannot distinguish words with similar contexts but opposite sentiment polarity. We propose a new method for learning domain-sensitive and sentiment-aware embeddings that simultaneously capture the information of sentiment semantics and domain sensitivity of individual words. Our method can automatically determine and produce domain-common embeddings and domain-specific embeddings. The differentiation of domain-common and domain-specific words enables the advantage of data augmentation of common semantics from multiple domains and capture the varied semantics of specific words from different domains at the same time. Experimental results show that our model provides an effective way to learn domain-sensitive and sentiment-aware word embeddings which benefit sentiment classification at both sentence level and lexicon term level.",

A standard strategy to construct poisoned data in backdoor attacks is to insert triggers (e.g., rare words) into selected sentences and alter the original label to a target label. This strategy comes with a severe flaw of being easily detected from both the trigger and the label perspectives: the trigger injected, which is usually a rare word, leads to an abnormal natural language expression, and thus can be easily detected by a defense model; the changed target label leads the example to be mistakenly labeled, and thus can be easily detected by manual inspections. To deal with this issue, in this paper, we propose a new strategy to perform textual backdoor attack which does not require an external trigger and the poisoned samples are correctly labeled. The core idea of the proposed strategy is to construct clean-labeled examples, whose labels are correct but can lead to test label changes when fused with the training set. To generate poisoned clean-labeled examples, we propose a sentence generation model based on the genetic algorithm to cater to the non-differentiable characteristic of text data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed attacking strategy is not only effective, but more importantly, hard to defend due to its triggerless and clean-labeled nature.

While recent research has relied on direct supervision for this task, we demonstrate that finetuning a RoBERTa model can result in a remarkable accuracy of 97.8%, which is a state-of-the-art performance. However, we contend that this exceptional result does not necessarily indicate a strong model of text coherence. Therefore, we propose that the Shuffle Test should be evaluated in a Zero-Shot setting, where models are not trained specifically for this task. We evaluate various models, such as Generative and Bi-directional Transformers, in this setting and find that larger architectures perform well without any prior training. Lastly, we introduce the k-Block Shuffle Test, a variation of the original test that increases the size of shuffled blocks. Although human readers still perform well (around 95% accuracy), model accuracy drops from 94% to 78% as block size increases, presenting a straightforward challenge to evaluate NLP models.",

In this study, we approach Procedural M3C at a finer level of granularity - the entity level - compared to existing studies that focus on documents or sentences. We model entities in their temporal and cross-modal relations and propose a novel Temporal-Modal Entity Graph (TMEG). The graph structure captures textual and visual entities and traces their temporal-modal evolution, and a graph aggregation module is introduced for graph encoding and reasoning. We conduct comprehensive experiments across three Procedural M3C tasks on both the traditional RecipeQA dataset and our new CraftQA dataset, which better evaluates the generalization of TMEG.

To address this issue, generating adversarial examples as augmented data has been proven to be effective. However, existing adversarial example generation (AEG) methods, which are either word-level or character-level, overlook the importance of phrase structure. To enhance the robustness of the translation model, we introduce a Phrase-level Adversarial Example Generation (PAEG) framework. Our approach improves upon the gradient-based word-level AEG method by incorporating a phrase-level substitution strategy. Our method is tested on three benchmark datasets: LDC Chinese-English, IWSLT14 German-English, and WMT14 English-German tasks. The results show that our approach significantly improves translation performance and robustness to noise compared to previous baselines.",

With thorough experimental studies, we show that the proposed method improves over the prior art in accurately emulating the desired emotions while retaining the naturalness of speech. We extend the traditional evaluation of using individual sentences for a more complete evaluation of HCI systems. We present a novel experimental setup by replacing an actor with a TTS system in offline and live conversations. The emotion to be rendered is either predicted or manually assigned.

Most existing debiasing methods are task-agnostic, which fail to utilize task knowledge to better discriminate between genuine and bias features. Motivated by how humans tackle stance detection tasks, we propose to incorporate the stance reasoning process as task knowledge to assist in learning genuine features and reducing reliance on bias features. The full stance reasoning process usually involves identifying the span of the mentioned target and corresponding opinion expressions, such fine-grained annotations are hard and expensive to obtain.

Most existing debiasing methods are not specific to the task and therefore, they are unable to effectively discriminate between genuine and biased features. Inspired by the human approach to stance detection, we propose incorporating the stance reasoning process as task knowledge to help learn genuine features and reduce reliance on biased features. The full stance reasoning process typically involves identifying the target span and opinion expressions, but obtaining fine-grained annotations for this is difficult and expensive. To overcome this, we simplify the stance reasoning process by reducing the granularity of annotations from token-level to sentence-level, making it easier to infer labels for sub-tasks from existing resources.

Consequently, it is more challenging to encode the key information sources—relevant contexts and entity types. However, existing methods only implicitly learn to model these critical information sources while being trained for RE. As a result, they suffer the problems of ineffective supervision and uninterpretable model predictions. In contrast, we propose to explicitly teach the model to capture relevant contexts and entity types by supervising and augmenting intermediate steps (SAIS) for RE. Based on a broad spectrum of carefully designed tasks, our proposed SAIS method not only extracts relations of better quality due to more effective supervision, but also retrieves the corresponding supporting evidence more accurately so as to enhance interpretability. By assessing model uncertainty, SAIS further boosts the performance via evidence-based data augmentation and ensemble inference while reducing the computational cost. Eventually, SAIS delivers state-of-the-art RE results on three benchmarks (DocRED, CDR, and GDA) and outperforms the runner-up by 5.04% relatively in F1 score in evidence retrieval on DocRED.",

Two major issues in existing systems that exacerbate the challenges: 1) temporal bias in pertaining and story datasets that leads to monotonic event temporal orders; 2) lack of explicit guidance that helps machines decide where to insert *flashbacks*. We propose to address these issues using structured storylines to encode events and their pair-wise temporal relations (before, after and vague) as **temporal prompts** that guide how stories should unfold temporally. We leverage a Plan-and-Write framework enhanced by reinforcement learning to generate storylines and stories end-to-end. Evaluation results show that the proposed method can generate more interesting stories with *flashbacks* while maintaining textual diversity, fluency, and temporal coherence.",

Specifically, we insert small bottleneck layers (i.e., adapter) within each layer of a pretrained model, then fix the pretrained layers and train the adapter layers on the downstream task data, with (1) task-specific unsupervised pretraining and then (2) task-specific supervised training (e.g., classification, sequence labeling).

If two words from distantly-related or unrelated languages sound similar and have a similar meaning, this is considered evidence of borrowing. This paper describes a method for automatically detecting loanwords across various language pairs, taking into account differences in script, pronunciation, and phonetic transformation by the borrowing language. The method uses edit distance, semantic similarity measures, and phonetic alignment. The results of the evaluation on 12 language pairs show that the performance of the method is comparable to or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods for single-pair loanword detection tasks. Additionally, the results demonstrate that multilingual models perform similarly or better than models trained on single language pairs, have the potential to generalize to unseen language pairs with sufficient data, and outperform human performance in loanword detection.",

Fake news is typically written intentionally to mislead readers, which determines that fake news detection merely based on news content is tremendously challenging. Meanwhile, fake news could contain true evidence to mock true news and presents different degrees of fakeness, which further exacerbates the detection difficulty. On the other hand, the spread of fake news produces various types of data from different perspectives. These multiple sources provide rich contextual information about fake news and offer unprecedented opportunities for advanced fake news detection. In this paper, we study fake news detection with different degrees of fakeness by integrating multiple sources. In particular, we introduce approaches to combine information from multiple sources and to discriminate between different degrees of fakeness, and propose a Multi-source Multi-class Fake news Detection framework MMFD, which combines automated feature extraction, multi-source fusion and automated degrees of fakeness detection into a coherent and interpretable model. Experimental results on the real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and extensive experiments are further conducted to understand the working of the proposed framework.",

Existing methods typically 1) treat three modal features (textual, acoustic, visual) equally, without distinguishing the importance of different modalities; and 2) split the video into frames, leading to missing the global acoustic information. In this paper, we propose a global Acoustic feature enhanced Modal-Order-Aware network (AMOA) to address these problems. Firstly, a modal-order-aware network is designed to obtain the multimodal fusion feature. This network integrates the three modalities in a certain order, which makes the modality at the core position matter more. Then, we introduce the global acoustic feature of the whole video into our model. Since the global acoustic feature and multimodal fusion feature originally reside in their own spaces, contrastive learning is further employed to align them before concatenation.

However, current methods have two shortcomings: they treat the three modal features (textual, acoustic, visual) equally, without considering their varying importance, and they split the video into frames, which results in the loss of global acoustic information. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Acoustic feature enhanced Modal-Order-Aware network (AMOA). Our network is designed to integrate the three modalities in a specific order, giving greater importance to the modality at the core position. We also introduce the global acoustic feature of the entire video into our model. To align the global acoustic feature and the multimodal fusion feature, we employ contrastive learning before concatenating them. Our experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, we extend our model to handle more complex sentiments, such as sarcasm detection, and achieve state-of-the-art performance on a widely used sarcasm dataset.",

In this paper, we first provide a thorough analysis of the above challenges caused by negative data. Next, we formulate the problem of relation extraction into as a positive unlabeled learning task to alleviate false negative problem. Thirdly, we propose a pipeline approach, dubbed ReRe, that first performs sentence classification with relational labels and then extracts the subjects/objects. Experimental results show that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing approaches and remains excellent performance even learned with a large quantity of false positive samples.

To address this issue, we propose a new prompting technique based on similarity metrics that enhances few-shot performance to the level of fully supervised methods. Our simple adaptation demonstrates that the failure of existing prompt-based techniques in semantic distinction is due to improper configuration rather than a lack of relevant knowledge in the representations. Additionally, we show that this approach can be effectively extended to other downstream tasks that require only a single prompt.",

We use this combination to estimate new training examples for grounding symbols that occur within a noun phrase but aren't designated by that noun phase (e.g, red in the above example), thereby potentially gaining data efficiency.

The proposed method accounts for the generation context by tuning the summary words at the time of generation. Our evaluations indicate that the proposed approach tunes summaries to the target vocabulary while still maintaining a superior summary quality against a state-of-the-art word embedding based lexical substitution algorithm, suggesting the feasibility of the proposed approach.

        "text": "In Neural Machine Translation (and, more generally, conditional language modeling), the generation of a target token is influenced by two types of context: the source and the prefix of the target sequence. While many attempts to understand the internal workings of NMT models have been made, none of them explicitly evaluates relative source and target contributions to a generation decision. We argue that this relative contribution can be evaluated by adopting a variant of Layerwise Relevance Propagation (LRP). Its underlying `conservation principle' makes relevance propagation unique: differently from other methods, it evaluates not an abstract quantity reflecting token importance, but the proportion of each token's influence. We extend LRP to the Transformer and conduct an analysis of NMT models which explicitly evaluates the source and target relative contributions to the generation process. We analyze changes in these contributions when conditioning on different types of prefixes, when varying the training objective or the amount of training data, and during the training process. We find that models trained with more data tend to rely on source information more and to have more sharp token contributions; the training process is non-monotonic with several stages of different nature.",

Specifically, to make use of the descriptive knowledge, we devise a Descriptive Graph Induction module to obtain and encode the graph-structured descriptive knowledge.
